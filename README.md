# DOM-Jeopardy

This lab is designed to be a practice in JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation. The goal is to gain familiarity with `.querySelector()`, `.addEventListener()`, `.createElement()`, iterating through arrays, and begin to explore some more intricate uses of DOM manipulation.

Let's get this party started!

# Jeopardy needs your help!

Trying to keep up with the ever changing times, Jeapordy is branching into the digital world and needs our help to prototype their ideas!

Thankfully, they have some data already packaged up into a nice `json` file already. It's currently in the `src` folder saved as `jeopardy_questions`. Let me take a little look at what we got here...

```
{
  category: "EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT IT...", 
  air_date: "2004-12-31",
  question:
    "'On June 28, 1994 the nat'l weather service began issuing this index that rates the intensity of the sun's radiation'",
  value: "$600",
  answer: "the UV index",
  round: "Jeopardy!",
  show_number: "4680",
}
```

import jeopardy questions into index.js
console.log index 0
make single display card for that one question
